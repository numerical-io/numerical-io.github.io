<h1>What we do</h1>
<p>
We help businesses find and exploit information in their data.
</p><p>
How to decrease the energy cost of a building? Ensure a vehicle
is safe? Have the right supply of every product for the coming
month? Find out which customers need one's full attention?
</p><p>
We turn such questions into mathematical models, and infer the
answers using machine learning. We develop software to integrate
the answers in our clients' processes. We have built or contributed
to models running daily in several industries.
